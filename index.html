        <h2 class="section-title">Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I was born 1999, <em>The</em> last possible year to join an <em>elite class,</em> consisting of 20th century people.</p>
        <p>I'm born and raised in Gothenburg, living a majority of my life in Linné. It is located close to most things but most importantly Slottsskogen.</p>
        <p>Freetime is something I enjoy the most with friends and family. In my teenage years I used to play
            a lot of videos games such as League of Legends & Runescape. But as time passed I've since grown away from it,
            getting more joy out of IRL experiences.</p>
        <p>Smögen is a place where I spend a lot of time. I have both friends and family over there. 
            The boys and I try to gather there every winter, easter and summer. You could call it our <em>headquarters</em>.</p>

        <h2 class="article-title">Healthy Eating</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">Eating well is something I've started both thinking & reading about a lot.
            When I was younger I blindly bought products where the ingredients-list looked like 
            <em>scientific study litterature</em>,
            without ever questioning what I actually was putting into my body. 
            Now I follow a few simple rules when consuming food and beverages:
        </p>
        <ol class="rule-list">
            <li>An ingredient should <em>NOT</em> contain multiple ingredients.</li>
            <li>Seed oils should be <em>avoided</em> if possible. (Since it is often used in non-nutritional foods)</li>
            <li>If possible, choose grassfed meat & eggs.</li>
            <li>Tactically consume carbs when you need it as fuel.</li>
            <li><strong>Today might be the last day. If the rules can't be followed, don't feel guilt,
                instead, <em>ENJOY YOURSELF!</strong></em></li>
        </ol>
